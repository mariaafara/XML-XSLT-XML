# XML-XSLT-XML


Suppose that we want to create a web application that manages the content of the meetings at
the Lebanese University. Each meeting produces a report containing information about the
meeting. Several types of meetings may exist: department meeting, section of faculty meeting,
faculty meeting, and finally university council meeting. In order to facilitate later searches in
the archives of meetings, information about each meeting is stored along with each report for
example the title, the main key points and the name of attendees. The website should allow us
to archive meetings and to display the stored meetings. Find below a page template that allows
to archive a new meeting.

     the DTD represents the information to be stored about the meetings.
     When the user clicks the button “Archive”, the data should be stored in XML according to the DTD proposed 
     the second page uses XSLT to display the meetings stored in XML
